I am interested in research in Image processing particularly using optimization and machine learning techniques. I am currently working with [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/) for my Bachelor's Thesis on Phase Retrieval. Apart from image processing, I am also interested in CUDA Programming and optimization. I have worked with [Prof. Dirk Kroese](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/DirkKroese/) on parallelizing Monte Carlo simulations using CUDA followed by an internship at NVidia this summer, where I worked on optimizing [Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf) and DBscan (a clustering algorithm).

For further insights into my work, please have a look at my [CV](https://chinmay0301.github.io/cv/cv_chinmay_2page.pdf). I maintain a brief account of my research experiences under the [Research Projects](./research) tab. 

I enjoy astrophysics and was involved extensively in the International Astronomy Olympiad Program as a participant while in high school and also as a academic committee member in 2016-17. I enjoy writing poetry and a bit of stand-up comedy, scenic photography, playing guitar and travelling in my leisure time.
