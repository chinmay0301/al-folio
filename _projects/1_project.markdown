description: Recovering a signal from Poisson corrupted Fourier magnitude measurements. Also looking into recovery of the original signal from clipped poisson corrupted measurements.

This is an ongoing project, hence will update the details when the project is completed. In brief, the aim of the project 
is to look into the following aspects of phase retreival -:
* To perform classic phase retrieval from poisson corrupted measurements in a non-compressive setting.
* To perform phase retrieval from sparse signals with poisson corrupted compressive measurements.
* Recovering signals from clipped poisson corrupted images. This problem occurs in a general setting too, not just phase retrieval. Trying to use approaches from compressed sensing with some additional information as to improve the estimates of the clipped signals.  

<!-- To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col three left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
</div>
