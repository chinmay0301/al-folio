title: Stochastic Modelling of Server Caches

The introductory courses in Data analysis and  Data Structures kindled my interest in graph theory and stochastics. I took up this project with [Prof. Sharayu](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/homepage/sharayum) with the aim to explore these fields into greater detail. I got a good insight into the application of bipartite graphs for modelling server caches. I studied a new algorithm known as the [Two Suggested Matching (TSM) ](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5438641/), which performs better than standard online algorithms for matching incoming requests to the files stored in the server. The above linked paper talks about using TSM in context of matching advertisements to incoming visitors on a web site, as to maximize the number of matchings between the advertisements and the visitors. I also implemented the hungarian algorithm and the standard online matching algorithm on octave.

Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col three left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
</div>
